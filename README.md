### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael, 18 years old and currently attending the department for informatics at the HTL St. PÃ¶lten with focus on Java, relational database design, network engineering and project management.

### Programming
Besides school I program a lot in my free time: web development with modern JS frameworks (React/Next, Vue), autonomous flying with drones (Python) + other projects.

### Creative
I've been using Photoshop for several years now and enjoy editing photos I've taken. I've also got some experience with Premiere Pro for editing videos.

### My work
