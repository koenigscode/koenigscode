### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael and currently attending the programme 'Software Engineering and Management' at the University of Gothenburg.

### Programming
Besides university I program a lot in my free time: web development with modern JS frameworks (i.e. React/Next), I did some autonomous flying with drones (Python), program with Flutter+Dart and work on other projects.
